(you don’t want to have to try to grab the pan out of hot water if you can help it.) however if you’re worried that your cheesecake might be slightly overbaked you’ll want to pull it out rather quickly and let it cool at room temperature. refrigerate for at least 3 hours before slicing. the cake can be refrigerated covered for up to 4 days. in a large heavy-bottomed sauté pan heat the butter until melted. stir in the granulated sugar brown sugar and honey and let cook until bubbling. add the apples and toss to coat. stir in the lemon zest lemon juice salt cinnamon cardamom and ginger stir to combine. cook for about 4 minutes or until the apples just start to soften. remove from the heat stir in the vanilla and transfer to a bowl to cool completely before use. the filling can be made up to 3 days ahead of time and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator.", "macros": {"calories": 1810.0, "protein_g": 123.4, "carbs_g": 123.4, "fat_g": 91.4}, "picture_url": "", "picture_source": "", "picture_license": "", "picture_attribution": "", "cc_wikimedia_search": "https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=Creole+Cream+Cheesecake+With+Caramel-Apple+Topping+food&title=Special:MediaSearch&type=image", "cc_pexels_search": "https://www.pexels.com/search/Creole+Cream+Cheesecake+With+Caramel-Apple+Topping+food/", "cc_pixabay_search": "https://pixabay.com/images/search/Creole+Cream+Cheesecake+With+Caramel-Apple+Topping+food/"}
